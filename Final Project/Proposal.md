Final Project Proposal

1) My final project will be to making an interactive rubik's cube. 
   The rubik’s cube will be able to rotate with the mouse and also be able to be randomize or shuffled. 
   As a stretch goal, I’ll add an option to change the rubik’s cube size such as 4x4 or 5x5.

2) Week 1: Find a model of a rubik’s cube
   Week 2: Complete the code to render the rubik’s cube with textures
   Week 3: Implement controls for the rubik’s cube and have it able to rotate
   Week 4: Implement the ability to randomize the rubik’s cube
   Week 5: (Stretch goal) Add option to change the size of the rubik’s cube

3) I will create a web-based application using three.js
